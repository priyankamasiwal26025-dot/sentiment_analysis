# 📝 Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Purpose
This project aims to perform **sentiment analysis** on product or customer reviews to automatically classify them as **positive** or **negative** using machine learning techniques.  
It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help understand customer opinions and improve business decision-making.

## Dataset Used
The dataset consists of text-based customer reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive/negative).  
It was preprocessed to remove noise, punctuation, and stopwords before being converted into numerical form using **TF-IDF** or **Bag of Words** vectorization.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data handling and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn**– for vectorization, model training, and evaluation  
- **NLTK** – for text preprocessing and tokenization  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for analysis and experimentation  

## Results
- The trained sentiment analysis model successfully classifies reviews with high accuracy.  
- Achieved an accuracy score of around **64%**.  
- Visualized performance using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.
